Hi! I'm Mike, a UK-based investor currently working in the healthcare sector and still in the early stages of my career. After becoming increasingly frustrated with the state of interest rates (back in 2018, before they became even worse) I started looking into investing - then following a year of underwhelming returns buying shares in UK businesses and after a lot of reading - investing specifically in US software businesses.

As a result, through a combination of misplaced high-conviction in my own stock-picking ability and sheer luck, I held a portfolio filled almost entirely with SaaS companies through the Covid crash. Needless to say, I'll be very lucky to have another investing year like 2020 in my lifetime. Yeah, I err... completely fluked it. So, why should you bother reading?

There are a few reasons for starting this journey:

- **The primary reason is to learn.** By posting publicly my aim is to more deeply understand topics that I may otherwise convince myself I have understood, where in fact upon questioning my explanation turns out to be a babbling mess. Having only invested for a few years so far, chances are that I haven't got it all figured out yet! By writing about my findings you can either learn along with me or, more likely, tell me why I'm wrong! 

- **To help demystify the noise**. If [recent reports](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/08/a-large-chunk-of-the-retail-investing-crowd-got-their-start-during-the-pandemic-schwab-survey-shows.html) are anything to go by, being stuck inside with nothing on which to spend increasing savings (for those of us lucky enough to have held onto jobs), 2020 caused a boom in retail investing. That's great, but only if people stick with it and take the time to educate themselves on the numerous facets of the markets.

- **To make investing fun.** Even as someone who is this far down the rabbit hole and has made it to the point of *wanting* to write about investing, I still find a large swathe of investment writing out there is dull. It's sometimes said that the process of effective investing should be boring but that doesn't mean learning about it has to be.

And now for some caveats. Do not read this newsletter if you:

- Are looking for deep technical dives on software businesses. There are many better corners of the internet that are far more capable of doing this. The writers behind [hhhypergrowth](https://hhhypergrowth.com/) and [SSI (Software Stack Investing)](https://softwarestackinvesting.com/) both have deep personal expertise in the sector and have produced an incredible number of excellent free-to-access articles. 
- Hate the idea of investing. That\'s sort of a core topic.

I think that's everything covered. I hope I manage to bring some small amount of enjoyment to the vast world of investment content. If there's anything you think I've got horribly wrong or if you just want to say 'hi', [please do get in touch!](mailto:asthecrowbuys@gmail.com)
